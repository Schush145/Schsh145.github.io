                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as 
the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is 
characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. 
Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are 
typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with 
males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its 
forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth 
and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is 
mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.</p>
                            <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. 
It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal's 
coat is white.[33] The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in 
both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage 
in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade. Studies in the wild 
have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration, while up close, 
they rely more on blending in.[35] The black ears may be used to display aggression, 
while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, 
woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>
                            <p>The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. 
It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and 
expanded temporal fossa. A study revealed that a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda had a 
bite force of 1298.9 Newton (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 Newton (BFQ 141.8) 
at carnassial teeth. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long, including a 
tail of about 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder.
Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb). Females are generally 10–20% smaller than males. 
They weigh between 70 kg (150 lb) and 125 kg (276 lb). The average weight for adults is 
100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb). The giant panda's paw has a digit similar to a thumb and five fingers; 
the thumb-like digit – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating. 
The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in), is the 
second-longest in the bear family, behind the sloth bear.</p>

                            <p>You will find the pandas at pen E31 by the stream of water</p>
