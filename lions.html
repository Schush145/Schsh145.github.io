                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
                            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, 
native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, 
rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, 
and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
The lion is an apex and keystone predator. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. 
It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active 
at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, 
from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in 
sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on 
the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by 
about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 
Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts 
with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
                            <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, 
a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light 
buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are 
generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, 
although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The tail of all lions 
ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, 
hard "spine" or "spur" composed of dermal papillae. The functions of the spur are unknown. 
The tuft is absent at birth, develops at around 5+1⁄2 months of age and is readily identifiable 
at the age of seven months. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, 
although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter 
postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of 
skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can 
be used as a reliable indicator of species. The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% 
of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals. 
The lion has a high concentration of fast twitch muscle fibres, giving 
them quick bursts of speed but less stamina.</p>
                            <p>Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. 
Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous. 
Like those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. 
During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, 
which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat. 
Lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. 
Males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before mounting each other. 
Generation length of the lion is about seven years. The average gestation period is around 110 days;
the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which 
may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. 
She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively 
close to the den. Lion cubs are born blind, their eyes opening around 
seven days after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, 
beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. 
To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs 
to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.</p>
