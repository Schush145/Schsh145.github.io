                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                            <p>From freaky spiders to smelly stink bugs.</p>
                            <p>Lady Bird Beetle (a.k.a. Ladybugs): Ladybugs are tiny, oval, 
winged beetles that are usually between 1 to 10 millimeters (mm) in length, depending on 
the species. They are typically bright red with black spots.eetles are believed to trigger allergies, 
ranging from eye irritation to asthma, potentially because they emit a stinky, yellow 
secretion when they feel they’re in danger. Lady bird beetles also can bite (it feels like a pinch), 
but they are not poisonous and are rarely harmful.</p>
                            <p>Brown Marmorated Stink Bug: This invasive bug is large, as it can 
grow up to 2 centimeters long. When you look at its abdomen from the top, just around where its 
wings are, you’ll see a marbled pattern on its back.Besides the pungent odor they give off, stink 
bugs do not bite humans or pets, but they can do a number on your garden.</p>
                           <p>Wolf Spider: Wolf spiders are hunting spiders—and can be 
pretty big, up to an inch and a half long,They are usually black, gray, or brown, and have a 
hairy appearance.Wolf spiders can bite, but only if they feel threatened. They would prefer to hide than bite</p>
                           <p>Cellar Spider (a.k.a. Daddy Long Legs): These are spindly spiders with 
long thin legs. The body of the cellar spider is usually 1/4- 5/16-inch-long, with legs 
extending another 2 inches. Cellar spiders are not venomous and not known to bite.</p>
                           <p>Asian Camel Cricket: These crickets are light brown, tan, and dark brown 
with a humped back. They have very long antennae, and their bodies grow 
between 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches long. Camel crickets do not bite and are not known to be harmful to humans and pets.</p>
                            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</strong></p>
                            <p>The Insect House is to the east of the Amphitheatre</p>
