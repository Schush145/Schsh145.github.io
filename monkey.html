                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                            <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder 
Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians 
are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete 
paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
                            <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as 
small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight,
to the male mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb).
Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the 
various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs 
and small animals (including insects and spiders). Some characteristics are shared among 
the groups; most New World monkeys have long tails, with those in the Atelidae family being prehensile, 
while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all.[32] Old World monkeys 
have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, 
dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the 
New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and 
New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, 
cheeks and rumps.</p>
                            <p>The most common monkey species found in animal research are the grivet, 
the rhesus macaque, and the crab-eating macaque, which are either wild-caught or purpose-bred. 
They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle 
(compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans. Worldwide, it is thought that 
between 100,000 and 200,000 non-human primates are used in research each year, 64.7% of which are 
Old World monkeys, and 5.5% New World monkeys.[68] This number makes a very small fraction of all 
animals used in research. Between 1994 and 2004 the United States has used an average of 
54,000 non-human primates, while around 10,000 non-human primates were used in the European Union in 2002</p>
