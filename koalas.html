                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                            <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes 
inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest 
living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the 
island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, 
Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body 
and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a 
body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). 
Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern 
populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. 
These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.
Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. 
This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that 
deter most other mammals from feeding on them. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 
twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males 
communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their 
presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Like other marsupials, 
koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their 
mothers' pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned 
around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens
 such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.</p>
                            <p>For a mammal, the koala has a disproportionately small brain, 60% smaller than 
that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only 19.2 g (0.68 oz) on average.The brain's surface 
is fairly smooth and "primitive".It does not entirely fill the cranial cavity, 
unlike most mammals,and is lightened by large amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. 
It is possible that the fluid protects the brain should the animal fall from a tree.
The koala's small brain may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, 
which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain. Its small brain limits its ability to 
perform complex behaviours. For example, it will not eat plucked eucalyptus leaves on a flat surface, 
which does not match its feeding routine. The koala has a broad, dark nose with a good sense 
of smell, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility. 
Its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits, an 
adaptation to living on a more vertical plane. Its round ears provide it with good hearing,
and it has a well-developed middle ear. The koala larynx is located relatively low in the vocal tract 
and can be pulled further down. They possess unique folds in the velum (soft palate), 
known as velar vocal folds, in addition to the typical vocal folds of the larynx. These features 
allow the koala to produce deeper sounds than would otherwise be possible for their size</p>
                            <p>Koalas are seasonal breeders, and they give birth from October to May. 
Females in oestrus lean their heads back and shake their bodies. Despite these obvious signals, 
males try to copulate with any female during this period, mounting them from behind. 
Because of his much larger size, a male can overpower a female. A female may scream and vigorously 
fight off her suitors but will accede to one that is dominant or familiar. 
The commotion can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating 
and fight off the intruders. A female may learn who is more dominant during these fights. 
Older males typically accumulate scratches, scars, and cuts on the 
exposed parts of their noses and their eyelids.</p>
